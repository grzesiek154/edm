# Compression

A compressor is basically an automated volume fader that turns down the peaks of your track – making it more even and easier to turn up in the mix. Compression squashes the waveform. That way, the track as a whole become more even.

Then, you can bring up the overall volume of the track and it will sit nicely in your mix. You can use compression to make things punchier, to shape a sound, to obtain a nice balance and so much more. 

## Threshold

Possibly the most important knob on any compressor is the threshold. The threshold is what allows the compressor to compress the track and control how much compression is applied. If the threshold is at zero, you can do whatever you want to the other knobs and nothing will happen. No compression will take place. Threshold is essentially just the volume at which the compressor turns down the signal.

 So, if you turn the threshold down just a little bit, it will only affect the very loudest points in the track. This is referred to as a very soft or light compression.

If you turn the threshold down further, the signal will get even more squashed. It will begin to affect the loud peaks as well as the peaks that are quieter. You can squash a signal to the point where it no longer has any dynamics.

## Ratio

This knob was always a little bit mysterious to me. I had read a few tutorials and found through trial and error that a 2:1 ratio tended to sound the best, but I still didn’t really know what it was doing.

However, it’s actually not very complicated. The Ratio knob works in conjunction with the Threshold. The Ratio determines how hard the compressor will kick in when the volume crosses the threshold.

So, a 1:1 ratio means the signal doesn’t get turned down at all when the volume crosses the threshold. A 2:1 ratio means the compressor will turn the signal down by half when it crosses the threshold. The higher the ratio, the harder the compressor will work. You can experiment with the ratio and the threshold to get as much or as little compression as you need.
